It should be fairly easy to customize headers for rig3 pages.

First, let's mention template themes.

The default template is "default". This means
rig3serv/templates/default/html_header.html is used to get the
template for a page (either an index or a month page, for all
categories or for specific categories.)

If you want to specialize the header, you can of course change the
default template.
Or a better way is to have your own theme. There are two "hidden"
themes, "magic" and "ralf" which are defined.
I reserve "ralf" for me, I reserve "magic" for you.

So just do something like this:
$ cd rig3serv
$ mkdir -p templates/magic
$ cp templates/default/html_headershtml templates/magic/html_header.html

This will create your own version of the header and it won't get
obliterated next time you do an svn update.

Then in your rig3.rc you just need a line like this:

[section]
theme = magic


Now in the header itself, you have some variables you can work with:
- "curr_category" is the name of the current category. It's going to
be an None or an empty string for the "all" page, and a specific
lowercase category name for others.
- "all_categories" is the list of all known categories in your posts
(dunno why you would want it here, but you have it so...)

To customize the header, you can use the "if" tag in rig3 templates.
The syntax would be something like this:

[[if curr_category == "vacation"]] ... some html stuff ... [[end]]

The "if" tag doesn't have an "else" or "elsif". You can nest them if
you need, though.
In this case if you need to switch the header according to N
categories, you need N "if" tags.

If what you want is customize the image in the default, header, you
can add the [[iff]] tag anywhere in the middle of html, of course, so
right in an <img src>, e.g.:

<div class="header"
style="height: [[html header_img_height]]px;
         width: 100%;
         background: no-repeat top center scroll
    [[if curr_category == "vacation"]] url(vacation.png) [[end]]
    [[if curr_category == "outing"]] url(outing.png) [[end]]
    ">
</div>

Of course if you know you have an image for each category possible,
you can simply use the variable as part of the URL, e.g.:

 <img src="pix/[[url curr_category]].png">

(the "url" tag means you don't trust the variable and you want
url-encoding applied to its text, in case of.)

Remember that in rig3 templates, anything after the first keyword in a
tag is a pure python statement.
So really you can write some interesting stuff.
Remember how I said "curr_category" is None or empty for "all"? Then
you can apply a default value as easily as:

 <img src="pix/[[url curr_category or "default" ]].png">

Hope this helps,
