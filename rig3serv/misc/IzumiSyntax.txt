Izumi Syntax

(TODO: header, description)



--------------------
1- Existing Tags
--------------------

**** Formatting tags:

For tags that have both start and end, they must be on the same line.

__bold__ : 2 underscore, something, two more underscores to close.

''italics'': 2 single-quotes, something, two more single quotes to close.

==code==: 2 equals, something, two more equals, generates an inline <code> block

You can combine them, i.e. __bold ''with ==code== italics''__ as long as they are nested properly.

Since 2 pairs of these characters are interpreted, if you want to write them in your
text, you need to add one extra character to escape it. So "====" generates "==", and
"====" generates "===" and so on.


**** Paragraphs:

Paragraphs are generated by empty lines.
Otherwise lines are automatically concatenated with a space in between.


**** List tags:

Currently the only supported list tags is "*" for first-level lists:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3...

The "*" must be the first character of the line and must be followed by one space.
Note: I plan on supporting multi-level unordered lists. I currently have no plans for
ordered lists (i.e. with 1./2./3. prefixes)


**** Structural tags:

All structural tags are enclosed in brackets: [tag].
To generate a text such as "[tag]", prefix it with a second "[" to prevent the expansion.
So "[[tag]" will output "[tag]", and "[[[tag]" for "[[tag]", and so on.
Tags which are not ignored are silently dropped.

[!-- .... --] denotes a comment. The content can be multiline. Comments are totally skipped
and can contain anything, even izumi tags you want to ignore. Comments cannot be nested.
The closing tag is "--]". Contrary to HTML, "--" is valid inside a comment.


Sections: [s:<lang>], such as [s:en] and [s:fr].


**** Auto-linking:

- named image link: [title|http://blah/blah.gif,jpeg,jpg,png,svg], without [[

- unnamed image link: [http://blah/blah.gif,jpeg,jpg,png,svg], without [[

-named link: [name|http://blah/blah], accept ftp:// and #name, without [[

- unnamed link: [http://blah/blah], accepts ftp:// and #name, without [[

- unformated link: http://blah or ftp:// (link cannot contain quotes)
	and must not be surrounded by quotes
	and must not be surrounded by brackets
	and must not be surrounded by < >        -- RM 20041120 fixed
	and must not be prefixed by [] or |
	(all these exceptions to prevent processing twice links in the form <a href="http...">http...</a>

- rig link: [name|riglink:image_glob]

This generates a *text* link onto a RIG image located in the *same* directory.
Glob cannot move accross directories. It has to be something like "344_*.jpg" for example,
not "../myimages/....". It replies on the site settings "rig_img_url" and "rig_base"
variables.

- rig image/thumbnail: [name|rigimg:size:image_glob]

This generates a rig image/thumbnail inserted in-place in the generated HTML.
It replies on the site settings "rig_thumb_url", "rig_base" and "rig_img_size" variables.

The "name" part, if present, is the title/tag of the generated <IMG> HTML tag.
It generally appears when hovering over the image.

The "size" is expressed in pixels. It is optional, in which case the default
value from "rig_img_size" is used.

The following syntaxes are valid:
	[name|rigimg:size:image_glob]
	[name|rigimg:image_glob]
	[rigimg:size:image_glob]
	[rigimg:image_glob]



**** Izumi Tags

Izumi tags are internal directives, either for the izumi parser or for the Rig3 parser.

The general syntax is: [izu:<tag>:<value>]
The value can be anything but a closing bracket.
As for any other tags, use a second opening bracket to invalidate it (i.e. [[izu:tag:value]).

The tags currently recognized by Rig3 are:
- cat: A comma-separated or whitespace-separated list of categories. Category names
       cannot contain commas nor whitespace. They are case-insensitive.
- date: An optional date for the post. If present, it will override the one extracted from the
       post's filename or directory name. The accepted formats are:
        YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
        YYYYMMDDHHM
        YYYYMMDD
       	YYYY-MM-DD,HH:MM:SS (accepted separators are - : / and , or space for date/time)
       	YYYY-MM-DD,HH:MM
       	YYYY-MM-DD
- title: An optional title for the post, which will override the one from the post's filename
       or directory name if present.
- author: The post's author. Treated as case-insensitive.

2- Future Tags
--------------------

Planned but not yet implemented yet:
- use \ at the end of line to concatenate lines
- multiple level <ul>
- blockquotes
- code blocks (aka <pre>)
- table
