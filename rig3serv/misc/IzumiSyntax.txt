Izumi Syntax

(TODO: header, description)



--------------------
1- Existing Tags
--------------------

Formatting tags:

For tags that have both start and end, they must be on the same line.

__bold__ : 2 underscore, something, two more underscores to close.

''italics'': 2 single-quotes, something, two more single quotes to close.

==code==: 2 equals, something, two more equals, generates an inline <code> block

You can combine them, i.e. __bold ''with ==code== italics''__ as long as they are nested properly.

Since 2 pairs of these characters are interpreted, if you want to write them in your
text, you need to add one extra character to escape it. So "====" generates "==", and
"====" generates "===" and so on.


Paragraphs:

Paragraphs are generated by empty lines.
Otherwise lines are automatically concatenated with a space in between.


List tags:

Currently the only supported list tags is "*" for first-level lists:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3...

The "*" must be the first character of the line and must be followed by one space.
Note: I plan on supporting multi-level unordered lists. I currently have no plans for
ordered lists (i.e. with 1./2./3. prefixes)


Structural tags:

All structural tags are enclosed in brackets: [tag].
To generate a text such as "[tag]", prefix it with a second "[" to prevent the expansion.
So "[[tag]" will output "[tag]", and "[[[tag]" for "[[tag]", and so on.
Tags which are not ignored are silently dropped.

[!-- .... --] denotes a comment. The content can be multiline. Comments are totally skipped
and can contain anything, even izumi tags you want to ignore. Comments cannot be nested.
The closing tag is "--]". Contrary to HTML, "--" is valid inside a comment.


Sections: [s:<lang>], such as [s:en] and [s:fr].


Auto-linking:

- named image link: [title|http://blah/blah.gif,jpeg,jpg,png,svg], without [[

- unnamed image link: [http://blah/blah.gif,jpeg,jpg,png,svg], without [[

-named link: [name|http://blah/blah], accept ftp:// and #name, without [[

- unnamed link: [http://blah/blah], accepts ftp:// and #name, without [[

- unformated link: http://blah or ftp:// (link cannot contain quotes)
	and must not be surrounded by quotes
	and must not be surrounded by brackets
	and must not be surrounded by < >        -- RM 20041120 fixed
	and must not be prefixed by [] or |
	(all these exceptions to prevent processing twice links in the form <a href="http...">http...</a>

- rig link: [name|riglink:image_glob]

This generate a *text* link onto a RIG image located in the *same* directory.
Glob cannot move accross directories. It has to be something like "344_*.jpg" for example,
not "../myimages/....".
Note: Soon another tag will generate an izu image in place.

2- Future Tags
--------------------

Planned but not yet implemented yet:
- use \ at the end of line to concatenate lines
- multiple level <ul>
- blockquotes
- code blocks (aka <pre>)
- table
